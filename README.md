## Quiz App with True/False Questions:

This quiz app is designed to test your knowledge with a series of true or false questions. The app provides a user-friendly interface where you can select your answer for each question. After submitting your answer, the app immediately displays whether your answer is correct or wrong, providing instant feedback. The app's simple yet engaging design makes it easy and enjoyable to quiz yourself or challenge your friends. Built using Flutter, the app showcases my skills in front-end development and UI design.
